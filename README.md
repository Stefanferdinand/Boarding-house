# Boarding House

A simple boarding house application built using MERN stack, mongoose, bootstrap, axios, and deployed using Heroku. This project is made by Stefan Ferdinand, Ariantoly, and Raksi Ghaly Rianto for our university group project.

## Development

To start development we would render the server side and client side seperately using 2 terminals. Below are the steps to start development process.

1. `npm install` (server-side initialization)
2. `cd client`
3. `npm install` (client-side initialization)
4. go to src > host.js, change host to development
5. `npm start` (starting client-side on 1st terminal)
6. add a new terminal
7. go to root project
8. `npm run dev` (starting server-side on 2nd terminal)
9. go to localhost:3000 (default port for client-side)

## Production

This project is already deployed using Heroku as a service to host our application. To view the deployment go to <https://boarding-house-se.herokuapp.com/>
